# Metro-Grow Toolkit

## Vision

Metro-Grow is an open-source initiative to empower communities to create sustainable, local food systems through vertical farming. We believe that urban agriculture can transform underutilized spaces into productive green hubs, reduce food miles, enhance food security, and foster community resilience. Our toolkit provides the knowledge, designs, and software needed for small-scale vertical farming projects that are affordable, replicable, and adaptable to diverse urban contexts.

## Target Audience

The Metro-Grow toolkit is designed for:
- **Community centers** looking to engage residents in hands‑on sustainability projects.
- **Schools and universities** seeking to integrate practical STEM education with environmental stewardship.
- **Small apartment buildings** where residents want to grow fresh produce in limited spaces.
- **Urban homesteaders** and DIY enthusiasts interested in low‑cost, high‑yield growing systems.
- **Local non‑profits** focused on food justice and community development.

## Core Components

The toolkit will include:

1. **Hardware Guides**
   - Step‑by‑step instructions for building vertical farming structures from recycled or locally sourced materials.
   - Recommendations for low‑cost sensors (pH, humidity, temperature, light) and control systems.
   - Electrical and plumbing schematics tailored for beginner‑friendly installation.

2. **Software Scripts**
   - Data‑logging utilities to monitor environmental conditions and plant health.
   - Basic automation scripts for watering, lighting, and nutrient delivery.
   - Visualization tools to help users interpret sensor data.

3. **Design Templates**
   - Modular, stackable planter designs that allow for easy scaling and reconfiguration.
   - Blueprints for integrated water‑circulation systems (e.g., passive wicking, recirculating hydroponics).
   - CAD files (where applicable) for laser‑cut or 3D‑printed components.

4. **Educational Resources**
   - Crop‑selection guides optimized for vertical growing.
   - Best practices for nutrient management, pest control, and harvesting.
   - Case studies of successful community‑led Metro‑Grow installations.

5. **Community Platform**
   - A space for users to share modifications, troubleshoot issues, and celebrate harvests.
   - Links to local suppliers, workshops, and funding opportunities.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from makers, gardeners, engineers, educators, and anyone passionate about urban food sovereignty. To keep the project accessible and collaborative:
